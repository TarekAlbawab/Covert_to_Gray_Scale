# Covert_to_Gray_Scale

A very simple program allows the user to upload a photo, grayscale it, and save the grayscaled photo.
The program was designed using C# language together with a AFORGE library. 
You may download AFORGE library in the following link: http://www.aforgenet.com/framework/downloads.html
